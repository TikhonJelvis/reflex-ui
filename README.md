# Reflex UI

A simple, high-level framework for building UIs with Reflex and GHCJS. Currently still a proof-of-concept.

The goal is to make building modern, responsive UIs easy without too much setup or HTML/CSS effort. Reflex UI will:

  * provide a clean, simple interface to the DOM via `reflex-dom`
    - opinionated: clean code for the 80% use-case over completeness
  
  * provide high-level UI elements like columns, grids and widgets
    - currently based on the [Bulma] CSS framework
    - good design by default rather than generality
